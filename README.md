<h2> Main components </h2>
This is a simple chess game. It is developed by me as my first programming project. <br>

This is a two player chess game. You can navigate through the consoule with your keyboard. <br>

In order to select one item of the board you need to push the P buttom. <br>

You can save the game and load your previous saves. <br>

Also, for every move you have 30s to take.
